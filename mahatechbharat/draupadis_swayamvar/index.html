<p>Draupadi, the princess of Panchala, was a woman of extraordinary brilliance and beauty. Renowned for her exceptional skills in history, geography, art, and warfare, she was a force to be reckoned with. King Drupad, her father, faced a daunting task: finding a suitable husband for a woman who surpassed most men in intellect and ability.</p>

<p>Arjuna, the third son of Kunti, was renowned as one of the greatest warriors of his time. Born under a divine blessing, he possessed unmatched skill and prowess with the bow and arrow. His archery abilities were so exceptional that he was often compared to the celestial archers of the gods.</p>
<p>Kunti, Arjuna’s mother, was a virtuous woman who had invoked the blessings of the five Pandavas from different Gods. Arjuna was born as a boon for her devotion to the god Indra, the king of all the gods. Alongside his brothers Yudhisthira, Bhima, Nakula, and Sahadeva, he formed the legendary Pandava clan.</p>
<p>Together, the Pandava were known for their bravery, righteousness, and unwavering bond. Arjuna, in particular, was admired for his unwavering dedication to his duty, loyalty to his brothers, and unparalleled skill with the bow. His exploits on the battlefield, including his victory over the mighty Drupad, solidified his reputation as one of the most formidable warriors of the Mahabharata.</p>
<p>Arjuna could have been a worthy contender as per Drupad. Known as the greatest archer of his time, Arjuna’s prowess was unmatched even by the Demigods. However, his cousin, Duryodhana, harbored jealousy and resentment towards the Pandavas. He hatched a sinister plan to eliminate them once and for all.</p>

<p>Duryodhana lured the Pandavas to a grand palace, supposedly a gift of hospitality. However, hidden beneath the opulent facade lay a deadly trap. Duryodhana planned to burn the palace to the ground, ensuring the Pandavas’ demise.</p>
<p>As the Pandavas settled into their luxurious quarters, unaware of the impending danger, Duryodhana’s plot unfolded. In the dead of night, he ignited the palace, engulfing it in flames. But the Pandava, ever alert and resourceful, had sensed the impending doom. They escaped the inferno, their lives miraculously spared.</p>
<p>Disguised and living in exile, the Pandavas mourned the loss of their opulent life. Yet, they carried on, their spirits unbroken, their determination unwavering. The fire that had nearly consumed them had instead forged their resolve, preparing them for the challenges that lay ahead.</p>

<p>The news of the ashes of the palace and the sad demise of Queen Kunti and her five sons left King Drupad with an aching heart. The flames that engulfed the palace of the Pandava had also torched his hopes and dreams. Draupadi, his cherished daughter, had found her perfect match in Arjuna. The fire had not just taken lives — it had extinguished the light of a union he had long awaited.</p>

<p>It was at this crucial juncture that the divine Krishna intervened. He revealed to King Drupad that the Pandava were alive and were living in disguise. The news filled Drupad with hope. He had to make arrangements for the grand Swayamvar for this beloved daughter.</p>

  Swayamvar — A Unique Challenge

<p>Determined to ensure that Arjuna was the only worthy suitor for Draupadi, King Drupad devised a challenging task. He announced a swayamvar, a grand event where eligible princes and kings could compete for Draupadi’s hand in marriage. The challenge was simple yet demanding: whoever could pierce the eye of a golden fish, suspended high above a pond, by looking only at its reflection would win the princess.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/draupadis-swayamvar/fish.webp" width="70%" height="auto">

<p>News of the swayamvar spread far and wide, attracting warriors from across the land. Among the contenders were many skilled archers, eager to prove their worth including the likes of Duryodhana, Karna, Duhshasana, Vikarna, Chitrasena, who all played crucial roles in the great war of Mahabharat. However, Krishna knew that only two men possessed the ability to accomplish this feat: Arjuna and Karna, the son of the Sun God.</p>
<p>Pandava attended Draupadi’s swayamvara disguised as Brahmins.</p>
<p>Karna, a prominent figure in the Mahabharata, was born to the unwed Kunti and the sun god Surya (more about his story in a separate post), was raised by a charioteer and his wife, which placed him in a lower caste. Despite his noble birth and inherent skills, his social status limited his participation in many public and royal events. Nonetheless, Karna’s exceptional prowess as a warrior earned him immense respect and fear on the battlefield. His skills rivaled those of Arjuna. Recognizing Karna’s formidable talent and unique ability to challenge Arjuna effectively, Duryodhana, honored Karna by making him the king of Anga, a barren land solidifying Karna’s allegiance and ensuring that his extraordinary combat abilities were harnessed against Arjuna.</p>

</h1>
<p>Krishna, ever the strategist, had a plan. He knew that Karna, a close friend of Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava, could pose a threat. If Karna were to win Draupadi’s hand, it could forge a powerful alliance between Duryodhana and King Drupad. To prevent this, Krishna took on the role of Draupadi’s advisor, guiding her with his divine wisdom.</p>
<p>As the swayamvar commenced, one by one, the princes and kings attempted the impossible task. Many failed even to lift the bow, while others, though skilled, couldn’t hit the moving target. The crowd grew disheartened, and King Drupad, in despair, lamented the decline of great warriors, “Is this earth devoid of any true warrior worthy enough of my daughter’s hand?”, cried Drupad.</p>
<p>Enraged by the perceived lack of talent, Karna, despite his low birth, stepped forward to accept the challenge. He had always been underestimated and yearned for recognition.</p>
<p>However, Krishna, knowing Karna’s connection to Duryodhana, whispered a warning to Draupadi. She, in turn, publicly declared that she would not marry a man of lower caste, even if he were to succeed.</p>
<p>Karna’s face darkened with fury and heartache. The sting of public humiliation pierced deeper than any battlefield wound. His rage was a tempest of injustice, while his sorrow echoed the cruel reality of his social exile. He was helpless. The organizer of the swayamvar had the authority to reject any contender without notice.</p>

<p>The stage was set for the ultimate performance, the challenge had become a matter of honor for all warriors, not just a test of skill. The audience would witness once in a lifetime display of archery. Arjuna, hidden in the shadows, emerged with commanding confidence. His chest was broad, his posture regal. He bowed deeply to King Drupad, Draupadi, Krishna, and the assembled spectators, acknowledging their presence. With a single, respectful nod from Drupad, Arjuna took his stance. In a heartbeat, he unleashed his arrow. Nobody knew when the aim was taken, when the arrow was drawn, when the arrow left, and when the target was hit. The audience could only hear a swift swoosh and a flash, and the fish was gone with the arrow. The target, hit with breathtaking precision, left the crowd in stunned silence.</p>
<p>As the echo of Arjuna’s triumphant shot faded, the arena erupted in a chorus of astonished cheers. King Drupad’s face beamed with immense joy, his heart swelling with pride as he witnessed the fulfillment of the challenge. Draupadi, her eyes alight with admiration, found in Arjuna not just a suitor, but a worthy equal who mirrored her strength and valor. Krishna, ever the sage orchestrator, stood silently, his subtle smile reflecting a deep satisfaction. By guiding Arjuna’s path, Krishna had sown the seeds of a brighter future for Bharat. In this moment, destiny’s threads wove a tapestry of hope and grandeur for the land.</p>
